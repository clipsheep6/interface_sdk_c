/**
 * \file
 * \brief C API: Unicode Normalization
 *
 * Old Unicode normalization API.
 *
 * This API has been replaced by the unorm2.h API and is only available
 * for backward compatibility. The functions here simply delegate to the
 * unorm2.h functions, for example unorm2_getInstance() and unorm2_normalize().
 * There is one exception: The new API does not provide a replacement for unorm_compare().
 * Its declaration has been moved to unorm2.h.
 *
 * <code>unorm_normalize</code> transforms Unicode text into an equivalent composed or
 * decomposed form, allowing for easier sorting and searching of text.
 * <code>unorm_normalize</code> supports the standard normalization forms described in
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/" target="unicode">
 * Unicode Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms</a>.
 *
 * Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
 * several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
 * In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the
 * "composed" form):
 *
 * \code
 *      00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
 * \endcode
 *
 * or as two separate characters (the "decomposed" form):
 *
 * \code
 *      0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
 *      0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
 * \endcode
 *
 * To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
 * treated as the same "user-level" character "A with acute accent".  When you are searching or
 * comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are treated
 * equivalently.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than one
 * accent.  Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
 * significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
 * really equivalent.
 *
 * Similarly, the string "ffi" can be encoded as three separate letters:
 *
 * \code
 *      0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 *      0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 *      0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I
 * \endcode
 *
 * or as the single character
 *
 * \code
 *      FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI
 * \endcode
 *
 * The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
 * it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
 * with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
 * identifies such characters by giving them "compatibility" decompositions
 * into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
 * will often want to use these mappings.
 *
 * <code>unorm_normalize</code> helps solve these problems by transforming text into the
 * canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first example above.
 * In addition, you can have it perform compatibility decompositions so that
 * you can treat compatibility characters the same as their equivalents.
 * Finally, <code>unorm_normalize</code> rearranges accents into the proper canonical
 * order, so that you do not have to worry about accent rearrangement on your
 * own.
 *
 * Form FCD, "Fast C or D", is also designed for collation.
 * It allows to work on strings that are not necessarily normalized
 * with an algorithm (like in collation) that works under "canonical closure", i.e., it treats precomposed
 * characters and their decomposed equivalents the same.
 *
 * It is not a normalization form because it does not provide for uniqueness of representation. Multiple strings
 * may be canonically equivalent (their NFDs are identical) and may all conform to FCD without being identical
 * themselves.
 *
 * The form is defined such that the "raw decomposition", the recursive canonical decomposition of each character,
 * results in a string that is canonically ordered. This means that precomposed characters are allowed for as long
 * as their decompositions do not need canonical reordering.
 *
 * Its advantage for a process like collation is that all NFD and most NFC texts - and many unnormalized texts -
 * already conform to FCD and do not need to be normalized (NFD) for such a process. The FCD quick check will
 * return UNORM_YES for most strings in practice.
 *
 * unorm_normalize(UNORM_FCD) may be implemented with UNORM_NFD.
 *
 * For more details on FCD see the collation design document:
 * https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu-docs/blob/main/design/collation/ICU_collation_design.htm
 *
 * ICU collation performs either NFD or FCD normalization automatically if normalization
 * is turned on for the collator object.
 * Beyond collation and string search, normalized strings may be useful for string equivalence comparisons,
 * transliteration/transcription, unique representations, etc.
 *
 * The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC.
 * Note also that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and often do not
 * encode any combining marks by themselves. For conversion to such character encodings the
 * Unicode text needs to be normalized to NFC.
 * For more usage examples, see the Unicode Standard Annex.
